LoL Recommended Item Changer
============================

The LoL Recommended Item Changer is exactly what it sounds, a small utility to change recommended items for the Mac version of League of Legends.

The days of editing INI files with item codes are over. Just click the champion you want, click on the items you want, then his CMD+S (or go to the deploy menu and hit save)

This application borrows shamelessly from the windows application to do the same thing. The main goal of this application is to bring the features of the windows application to Mac usesrs.

Features
--------

* Select from any of the League of Legends champions/items
* Choose a League app file (in case you have multiple)
* Import build codes from the Windows version to share builds
